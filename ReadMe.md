Step 1: Ask Questions
The project initiated with the formulation of questions such as the distribution of car prices, the impact of condition on prices,
and the relationship between manufacturing year and price.

Step 2: Wrangle Data
Data wrangling involved addressing missing values and ensuring data quality. This step ensured a clean and reliable dataset 
for analysis.

Step 3: Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Exploratory Data Analysis revealed significant insights. Cars in excellent condition were identified to have higher prices.
Outliers in the price distribution were identified, and the distribution of mileage across different conditions was explored.

Step 4: Draw Conclusions (or even make Predictions)
The analysis pointed out that cars in excellent condition tend to have higher prices. The relationship between manufacturing
year and price was explored, indicating potential trends.

Step 5: Communicate Your Results
Visualizations, including histograms and box plots, effectively communicated key findings. The introduction of a new 'age' 
feature through feature engineering enhanced our understanding of the dataset.

Overall Concept:
The project systematically navigated through the data analytics process, leveraging visualizations and statistical analyses to uncover patterns and insights. 
Key findings include the influence of car condition on prices, the identification of outliers, and trends in average prices based on manufacturing years. 
The project contributes valuable knowledge to both buyers and sellers in the automotive market, facilitating informed decision-making.
